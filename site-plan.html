      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I am going to create a website for my wife’s waxing studio. She wants to have a more flexible layout than her current website offers. In addition, she would like to add a more personal touch by including a blog page, photo gallery, and product page. The website will need to be optimized for mobile devices since most of her customers book through their phone. Finally, the website will include links to her social media sites.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        FAQ
Does it hurt?
	Waxing hair removal has been around for a long time. While it can be an uncomfortable experience, our clients are always pleased with their results. 
How long is a typical service?
	I book out services for 30 minutes but you can expect your Brazilian wax to take only 15 minutes
Can I get waxed while I’m pregnant?
	Yes up until you give birth. Your Brazilian area will be slightly more sensitive due to pregnancy. 
How much time between waxes?
	We encourage clients to return every 4 weeks to get waxed. This helps the hair to get on the same growth cycle to eventually have an easier and smoother wax. For this reason, we encourage clients to not shave between appointments. 
Waxing vs. Laser Hair removal
Waxing is a great alternative to laser hair removal. It’s cheaper and less painful and has better long-term results.
